# 371---Roads
A Project on estimating the short path between randomly generated locations.

Road networks are modelled utilising Graph Theory.  Locations are used as the vertices in the graph while the roads between locations 
are used as the edges of the graph.  The edges are given weights based on the distance of the road section between two locations. 

For a set of locations and possible road segments which have been randomly generated, you are to store the location and segment data
in a graph. You will then investigate the distance and route of the shortest path from the capital to all other locations based on 
distance and additional weights based on "costs" for each segment.
